=begin
whatever you learn you should be able to pass it on (not like a parrot!) bigger the chunk, better.
spend time to play with whatever you learn in a compiler. 
Playing has 2 sections:
1) learning the language: 
be able to compile what you learned, dive deeper to have a better understanding (change stuff). Create more examples.
BE CURIOS!
2) PROBLEM SOLVING AND ALGORITHM: 
leetcode problems... solve as many questions as possible, do not spend days on a single questions.
whenever youre stuck, try to break it down. still blocked? move on the the next one and come back to it from time to time.
