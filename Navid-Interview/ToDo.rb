# MARCH 06: 
# make a folder for each of the leetcode problems that I have on GitHub:
# 2 files: 1. Problem statetment(include both the leetcode link and copy or rewrite the problem) 2. solution(have one file for each type of solution)
# add another solution useing not while loop :D 
# make sure that the argument passed to the function is different from the parameter defind in the function
# find the difference between "argument" and "parameter"

def function(x) # parameter
    puts x
end
a = 0
function(2) # argument

# spend 15 minutes a day on ruby programming (hackerrank/ exercism/ tutorial points: make it easy!)
# spend 30 minutes leet code
# spend 15 jerking off to your code (it better be a good code!)
# loop at the top solutions in leet code and rewrite one of them


#===WORK
# be curious
# fidle around with the code in your personal branch, test and change and learn
# do one PR and/or 10 hours per day
